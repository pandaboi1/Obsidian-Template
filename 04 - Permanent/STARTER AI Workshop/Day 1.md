#### Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)
Made up from **two** parts [[#Machine Learning]] and [[#Machine Reasoning]].  Understanding why both are important you can build a parameters to prevent disasters in any groups. 

Humans can understand reason and learn, and they recommend to read [“Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) gain insight on *why* we think like this. 

#### Machine Learning
Given background knowledge, positive and negative examples of a concept (training data), goal of machine learning is to learn the general rule or function that captures that concept. 

##### Neural Networks
- Information is processed in **neurons**
- Signals are passed between neurons via connection links
- Each connection link has an associated weight, which multiplies the signal being transferred.
- The weight decided the output of the neural network 
- Each neuron applies an activation function to its net input  (sum of individual inputs) to get its output

##### Training (Backpropagation)
- The process of finding appropriate weights it called *training*
- 

##### Applications of Neural Networks
- Are 
#### Machine Reasoning
Given pieces of information (axioms) deduce new knowledge
