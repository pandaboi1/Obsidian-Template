### Building AI Equality and Fairness

Founded [MedCognetics](https://www.medcognetics.com) an unbiased AI company for healthcare. [link to section](#MedCognetics)
#### AI Evolution (past to future)
- ANI.
	- Virtual assistant
	- Image recognition
	- Recommendation Algorithm
	- Autonomous Vehicle
- AGI (We are here)
	- Positive development
	- Significant social benefits
- Super Intelligent AI ASI
	- Transformative but unpredictable 
	- Solve complex problems
	- May pose existential threat
- Sentient AI
	- Philosophical currently
	- Pose ethical & existential threat

#### Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)
Made up from **two** parts [[#Machine Learning]] and [[#Machine Reasoning]].  Understanding why both are important you can build a parameters to prevent disasters in any groups. 

Humans can understand reason and learn, and they recommend to read [“Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) gain insight on *why* we think like this. 

#### Machine Learning
Given background knowledge, positive and negative examples of a concept (training data), goal of machine learning is to learn the general rule or function that captures that concept. 

##### Neural Networks
- Information is processed in **neurons**
- Signals are passed between neurons via connection links
- Each connection link has an associated weight, which multiplies the signal being transferred.
- The weight decided the output of the neural network 
- Each neuron applies an activation function to its net input  (sum of individual inputs) to get its output

##### Training (Backpropagation)
- The process of finding appropriate weights it called *training*
- 

##### Applications of Neural Networks
- 
#### Machine Reasoning
Given pieces of information (axioms) deduce new knowledge

#### MedCognetics 
##### Their Research
- Has built their model for diversity
- Specialization on Breast Cancer
