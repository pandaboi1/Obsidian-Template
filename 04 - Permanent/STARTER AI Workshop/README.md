STARTER (South Texas AI Research, Training, and Education Resource) is a project funded by NSF under the ExpandAI program aimed at establishing a robust foundation for Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered research and education at UTRGV. We aim to empower faculty and students to become experts in AI technologies and enable them to conduct their AI projects.

This inaugural workshop is the first in a series planned over the next two years to expand AI capacity (research, training, and computing) at UTRGV. We anticipate that the workshop will seed a thriving community of AI practitioners, comprised of faculty and students.
